 		Like other high peaks in the region, Mount Everest has long been revered by local peoples. Its most common Tibetan name, Chomolungma, means <q>Goddess Mother of the World</q> or <q>Goddess of the Valley.</q> The Sanskrit name Sagarmatha means literally <q>Peak of Heaven.</q> Its identity as the highest point on the Earthâ€™s surface was not recognized, however, until 1852, when the governmental Survey of India established that fact. In 1865 the mountain &#45; previously referred to as Peak XV &#45; was renamed for Sir George Everest, British surveyor general of India from 1830 to 1843.

 		Everest is composed of multiple layers of rock folded back on themselves (nappes). Rock on the lower elevations of the mountain consists of metamorphic schists and gneisses, topped by igneous granites. Higher up are found sedimentary rocks of marine origin (remnants of the ancient floor of the Tethys Sea that closed after the collision of the two plates). Notable is the Yellow Band, a limestone formation that is prominently visible just below the summit pyramid.
